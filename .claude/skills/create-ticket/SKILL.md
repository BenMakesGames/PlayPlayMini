# Create Ticket: $ARGUMENTS

Create one or more implementation tickets from the user's feature description. Tickets must be detailed enough that `/implement-ticket` can implement without ambiguity. Workflow:

## Phase 1: Research

Thorough codebase research is critical — tickets referencing wrong patterns or missing existing infrastructure cause implementation friction.

1. Find and read related completed tickets in `docs/tickets/complete/` for domain context, prior decisions, and known gotchas — not as a format to copy (the Phase 4 template is the authority on ticket shape).
2. Read relevant `docs/` reference files for areas involved.
3. Identify existing codebase patterns relevant to the feature. User may reference analogous systems (e.g., "like the inventory system", "similar to how achievements work"). Read those systems thoroughly — modules, components, data structures, helpers — for context.

## Phase 2: Clarify

Before asking, sort each open question into one of three buckets. Only the first goes to the user.

**Ask the user — design-level or architecture-level decisions the implementer can't unilaterally make.**

- Requirements with multiple interpretations or that contradict documented design
- Domain-specific values, names, configs the codebase can't tell you (e.g., balance numbers, copy strings, design intent)
- Scope boundaries — what's in vs. out for each ticket
- Dialog vs. page, modal vs. inline, separate state vs. flag on existing state
- Public API surface, breaking changes, cross-module contracts

**Defer to the implementer — leave un-decided, don't ask the user.** Implementer is another instance of you running `/implement-ticket` with full research access; trust them with local taste:
- Local idiom (HashSet vs. Dictionary, list vs. array, struct vs. record)
- Easing curves, animation timing tweaks, exact pixel offsets
- Field names, variable names, method names within an established pattern
- Inline helper vs. extract class — when both reasonable
- Micro-style: (a) vs. (b) when both work and neither is clearly better

For defer-class questions, either omit or surface under "Open Decisions" (see template) — never pre-decide for the implementer, never bother the user.

**Don't ask — research first.** Anything answerable by reading code. If unsure, read before asking.

Keep questions focused, concrete, bucketed. Don't pad user's queue with implementer-class questions.

## Phase 3: Scope

Determine how many tickets are needed. User may describe one or several related features. Consider:

- **One ticket per deployable unit**: Each ticket implementable and testable on its own
- **Dependency ordering**: If B depends on A's artifacts, list in B's Prerequisites
- **User guidance**: User may suggest a split — follow their lead

Present proposed split to user; confirm before writing.

## Phase 4: Write Tickets

Write each ticket to `docs/tickets/<ticket-name>.md`. **No** date prefix (added on completion) or numeric index (e.g., `03-user-auth.md`) — Prerequisites carries ordering, more flexible than linear sequence. Descriptive names only.

### Ticket Shape

**Ticket shape varies by task type.** Match format to work, not the other way around:

- **Implementation tickets** — full template below (numbered steps, files, test plan). Flat `## Implementation` with numbered steps in execution order. No grouping subsections (Model / Service / UI) — if ticket needs them, split it or re-sequence steps.
- **Design tickets** (e.g., a data-model decision, naming conventions) — simpler format: Context, design-specific sections, minimal test plan.
- **Refactoring tickets** — flat `## Implementation` with numbered steps across the whole stack.

### Implementation Ticket Template

Sections ordered for top-down reading by LLM implementer: gate checks (Prerequisites), boundary + orientation (Scope, Relevant Docs, Constraints), decisions before steps (Open Decisions, Acceptance Criteria), then work (Implementation, Test Plan).

```markdown
# Ticket Title

## Context
**Current behavior**: What exists today.
**New behavior**: What exists after implementation. Lead with user-visible / system-level change in one sentence, add nuance after. Serves as ticket summary — no separate Summary section.

## Prerequisites
- Tickets, features, or artifacts that must exist before implementation
- Omit entirely if none

## Scope
### In scope
Brief summary of goals + areas touched (e.g., "new data model + service layer, extends notification system, adds settings UI"). Blast-radius overview, not file manifest — Implementation lists files.

### Out of scope
Explicit non-goals: things a reader might assume are included but aren't, plus deferred follow-ups. Omit only if nothing to call out.

## Relevant Docs & Anchors
Pointers to read before coding:
- **Design docs**: e.g., `docs/architecture.md §Auth`, `docs/data-model.md §Users`.
- **Related tickets**: completed tickets with relevant background or gotchas (e.g., `docs/tickets/complete/2026-04-19 user-auth.md`) — for context, not a structure to copy.
- **Code anchors**: key symbols/methods to read first (`UserRepository.FindById`, `AuthService.Authenticate`, the request-dispatch loop in `Router.Handle`).

Omit if Implementation steps already name everything needed.

## Constraints & Gotchas
Optional. Cross-cutting hazards affecting multiple steps, easy to miss if buried inline:
- Project reference rules (e.g., the data layer cannot import the UI layer).
- Expected compiler/linter warnings (e.g., a non-exhaustive-match warning on an enum switch).
- Save-format / serialization compatibility constraints.
- Framework quirks documented in earlier ticket Learnings.

Omit if none apply.

## Open Decisions
Optional. Defer-to-implementer decisions worth surfacing — local-taste questions the implementer should call during coding (optionally raising with user) rather than pre-deciding here. Omit if none. Each point: one line, question + default if known.

Example entries:
1. **Easing curve** — linear vs. smoothstep for the fade-in animation. Default: linear; eyeball during manual testing.
2. **Inline helper vs. dedicated class** — inline simpler; dedicated right if reuse is imminent. Default: inline.

## Acceptance Criteria
Verifiable assertions defining "done" — user-visible behavior, public API outcomes, test-observable invariants, and (when the ticket *is* about adding code shape) enum values, registry entries, or file existence. Each unambiguously pass/fail by code inspection or unit test. **Distinct from Test Plan**: *what must be true*, not *how to verify*. Don't restate Test Plan steps.

**Avoid in AC**: private field names, internal state transitions, statement ordering inside a method. Those lock the implementer into one shape when other shapes satisfy the same behavior — they belong in Constraints or Implementation.

- [ ] Example (registry-shape ticket — code shape *is* the deliverable): "`RoleRegistry[Role.Editor]` populated with its permission set and display label matching `docs/roles.md §Editor`."
- [ ] Example (behavioral ticket): "With rate-limiting enabled, the 11th request within a minute returns HTTP 429; the counter resets after the window elapses."

## Implementation
Flat numbered list. **No grouping subsections** — if ticket needs Model / Service / UI sub-headers, split it or re-sequence into one linear flow.

### 1. Step Title
Why (intent) → where (anchor by symbol/pattern, never line number) → what (prose, not transcribed code).

### 2. Next Step Title
...

## Test Plan
Manual + integration verification of acceptance criteria: build/test commands, manual run-through steps, regression spot-checks. Action-oriented ("Open settings, change theme, reload — confirm theme persists"). **Distinct from Acceptance Criteria**: *how to verify*, not *what must be true*.

- [ ] Example: "The project builds and the test suite passes."
- [ ] Example: "Sign in as a new user; the dashboard shows zero notifications."
```

### Writing Guidelines

- **Lead with intent, follow with location**: State *why* before *where*. The why survives refactors; the where may drift.
- **Be specific about what, directional about how**: Name exact files, entities, enums. For signatures and types, point to the method/entity to mirror rather than spelling out the full signature — transcribed signatures go stale.
- **Don't transcribe method bodies**: Describe algorithm in prose, point to analogous method; don't paste full code into the ticket. Transcribed bodies go stale on first refactor of surrounding conventions (field naming, helpers, idioms). Exception: tricky off-by-one math, non-obvious algorithm steps, or specific data shapes where prose is ambiguous — transcribe only the load-bearing fragment, not the whole method.
- **No line numbers**: Never cite as `File.cs:388-395`. Line numbers rot on first edit above the region. Anchor by method name, pattern, or grep-able landmark (e.g., "the request-dispatch loop in `Router.Handle`", "the `new Connection(...)` call site in `Db`").
- **Mirror existing patterns by reference**: For analogous code, name the exemplar and call out only the *differences*. Don't transcribe the full structure — it may have changed by implementation time.
- **Keep scope tight**: One coherent unit of work per ticket. If it feels too large, split it.
- **Don't over-specify presentation**: Enough structure (component names, layout sketches, behavioral descriptions) to build it, but don't dictate every styling detail or exact position.
- **Defer local-taste decisions to the implementer**: For choices between reasonable local idioms (HashSet vs. Dictionary, inline list vs. dedicated class, easing curve, exact field name), don't pre-decide. Omit or surface under "Open Decisions" with a default.
- **Prefer symbols over paths**: Anchor by symbol name (`AuthService.Authenticate`, `OrderStatus` enum, `RetryPolicy` class) — durable across moves/renames, grep-able. Add a path only when the symbol is ambiguous or the implementer would have to hunt. Inline paths in the step that needs them, not in a separate sidebar.
- **Assume the implementer verifies**: Tickets read alongside current codebase. Provide enough to orient (files, patterns, analogues), don't be a frozen snapshot.

## Phase 5: Review

After writing, quick self-check on things Writing Guidelines don't catch:

- Does each ticket's Prerequisites accurately list what must exist first, and do tickets order so dependencies flow forward (no cycles)?
- Would an implementer running `/implement-ticket` have enough orientation (Relevant Docs & Anchors — design docs, related tickets, code anchors) to start without a guess-and-grep pass?
- Are Acceptance Criteria unambiguously pass/fail by code inspection or unit test, and *disjoint* from Test Plan steps (no item restated as both)?
- Are cross-cutting hazards (project reference rules, expected warnings, save-format compat) hoisted to Constraints & Gotchas instead of buried in a single Implementation step?
