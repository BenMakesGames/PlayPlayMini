# What Is It?

`PlayPlayMini` is an opinionated framework for making smallish games with `MonoGame` in .NET.

It provides a state engine with lifecycle events, dependency injection using `Autofac`, and several built-in services to help with common tasks, such as `GraphicsManager`, which provides methods for easily drawing sprites & fonts with a variety of effects.
