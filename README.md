# What Is It?

`PlayPlayMini` is an opinionated framework for making smallish 2D games with `MonoGame` in .NET Core.

It provides a state engine with lifecycle events, dependency injection using `Autofac`, and several built-in services to help with common tasks such as drawing sprites & fonts, and getting user input.
